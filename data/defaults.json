		this is just so you can easily recognize what kind of tile you are making
		
		the first number defines the color. set a 0 to make a blank space
		0x: empty space    5x: yellow
		1x: gray           6x: purple
		2x: red            7x: orange
		3x: green          8x: black
		4x: blue           9x: RNG tile
		
		the second number is the attribute of the tile being placed
		x0: sets a regular tile
		x1: sets a bomb
		x2: sets a detonator
		x3: sets a box
		x4: sets a key
		
		x7: sets the unspawnable attribute. unspawnable tiles wont randomly place  color on that tile
		x8: sets the dynamic camera on/off
		x9: sets the player spawn point. (if there are multiple spawn points in a livel, the last one will be used.)"
